# VAPT Security - User Guide (v4.1.1)

This guide provides an overview of the security features enabled by the VAPT Security plugin and instructions on how to verify they are working.

## Features & Verification

### 1. WP-Cron Protection
**What it does:**
Protects your site from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting the `wp-cron.php` file. It blocks external requests to this file unless they come from authorized IP addresses or contain a secret key.

**How to Verify:**
1.  Open your browser and visit: `https://wptest.local/wp-cron.php`
2.  **Result:** You should see a blank screen or a simple "Access Denied" / 403 error message (depending on configuration), indicating that external access is blocked.
3.  *Note:* Cron jobs triggered internally by WordPress will still function correctly.

### 2. Input Validation
**What it does:**
Sanitizes and validates incoming data (POST/GET requests) to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection attacks. It strips malicious tags and characters before they reach the application.

**How to Verify:**
1.  Try to submit a comment or form with a test script tag, e.g., `<script>alert('test')</script>`.
2.  **Result:** The plugin should sanitize this input. When the content is displayed or saved, the script tags will be removed or encoded (e.g., `alert('test')`), and the popup code will **not** execute.

### 3. Rate Limiting
**What it does:**
Prevents brute-force and spam attacks by limiting the number of requests a single IP address can make within a specific timeframe (e.g., form submissions).

**How to Verify:**
1.  Rapidly refresh a page with a form or try to submit a form multiple times in quick succession (e.g., 10 times in 10 seconds).
2.  **Result:** After exceeding the limit, you will see a "Too Many Requests" error or be temporarily blocked from accessing the site.

### 4. Security Headers
**What it does:**
Adds HTTP security headers (like X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection) to your site's responses to harden it against clickjacking and other browser-based attacks.

**How to Verify:**
1.  Use a tool like `securityheaders.com` or check your browser's Developer Tools (Network tab).
2.  **Result:** You should see headers like `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` in the response.

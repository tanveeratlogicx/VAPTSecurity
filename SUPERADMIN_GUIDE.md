## Domain Admin Access

The "Domain Admin" control panel is hidden and accessible only to the Superadmin (`tanmalik786`).

### Access Requirements:
1.  You must be logged in as the specific superadmin user.
2.  You will be prompted to complete an OTP verification step upon first access.

### Configuration Generator
Use the "Domain Admin" page to:
*   Generate `vapt-locked-config.php` files for other domains.
